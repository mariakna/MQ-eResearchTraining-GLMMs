# MQ-eResearchTraning--G-LMEmodels
Short webinar on how to fit (G)LME models in R (part of eResearch Training at MQ, Feb 18, 2021)

## Abstract

In this webinar, I will use accuracy and response times data to demonstrate how to fit (generalised) linear mixed effects models in R. I will walk you through the data analysis process step by step, from preparing raw data for analysis to computing descriptive summaries and plotting to fitting the model(s) and assessing the model fit. Special attention will be placed at contrast coding and model simplification. 

## Prerequisites
As this talk will focus on fitting the models in R, sound theoretical knowledge of the (generalised) linear mixed effects models is a pre-requisite. You don't need to be an expert R user to attend, but familiarity with the R environment is highly recommended.
